# Discourse : The Debating app

It’s truly fascinating to acknowledge how we prefer rivers over puddles .While the former flows and expands ,the latter is stagnant . 

In the millennial times,where everything around us is constantly changing ,there arises a need for a platform wherein people can ideate , express and take their stand towards a particular topic.

Introducing ‘Discourse’,for the first time ever a unique ‘debating’ app where you are in charge of your ideas and opinions.Let your voice be heard , be it political,financial,social,trending topics.

As there are always 2 sides for a story , place your opinion to the opposite side of the same topic and debate it out . Updated daily with the trending topics , features to differentiate the for and the against side of a particular topic and much more !


# Built for Hackverse 2.0-NITK Surathkal

The primary goal of the application is to promote contactless experiences along with ensuring that all of us are connected to the latest ongoings and happenings of the world and to provide a platform wherein everybody could take a standpoint for a particular topic and debate over various topics to present their perspectives and listen to other's opinions and thoughts.

# Tracks 

1) Let's connect

   Discourse enables thinkers,critics and people like us to express our ideas and present our standpoint regarding a particular topic . There is a very good opportunity to bond    with like minded folks along with hearing rational points from the other side to maintain an overall sanctity of the discussion. 
		
   We often have ideas and opinions but are devoid of a dedicated platform meant to promote healthy discussion from both the sides of a particular topic.This was the main idea      behind 'Discourse' ,to provide a level playing field to everyone and ensure in shaping up a constructive and well informed community. 

2) Let's go contactless
		
   The need of the hour is to implement processes which are devoid of human contact and could be digitized by making use of the technology known to us . While there are many 
   debate groups and clubs in almost every college,school,not everybody prefers the conventional way of having a proper audio-video setup(during the current pandemic) ,ensuring    how presentable they are etc .
		
   We have designed 'Discourse' to people who are ready to debate over their concerned topics right at the comfort of their phone where ever they are ,without worrying about        any formalities,whatsoever .
